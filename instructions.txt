## Adding a new module
When adding a new module, eg. 'test_module', add it to lib.rs as it orchetrates all files for the /src folder. 
It can then be used in other modules (files). Internally inside of /src as 'use crate::test_module' or externally as 'use gc_machine::test_module', like in the integration tests. 

## Adding a new unit test
To add a new unit test, add it to mod.rs as it orchetrates all files for the submodule of unit tests. Compiler uses mod.rs to know which files to use when compiling.

## Run tests
Use `cargo test``
This will run both integration tests in /tests and unit_tests. It looks for [#tests] and runs them.

## Run bench
cargo bench

## Clean the repo
Run `cargo clean`
This also removes the target directory where the benchmark files are located.
